However, it lacks the specific mention of government authorities assessing fines, which is a key detail from the reference, making it slightly less complete.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:What was the balance of intangible assets as of December 31, 2024?\n","Assistant Answer:The balance of intangible assets as of December 31, 2024, was $1,421.\n","Latency:3008.03 ms\n","Reference Answer:The balance of intangible assets as of December 31, 2024, was $1,425.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 2/5  \n","REASONING: The model output provides an incorrect balance of intangible assets, stating $1,421 instead of the correct amount of $1,425, which constitutes a factual error. Additionally, the output does not include any additional context or details, making it incomplete.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:How many jurisdictions does the text explicitly mention the company is evaluating for further licenses?\n","Assistant Answer:The text explicitly mentions the company is evaluating 12 jurisdictions for further licenses.\n","Latency:2119.19 ms\n","Reference Answer:The text explicitly mentions four jurisdictions the company is evaluating for further licenses.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 1/5  \n","REASONING: The model output incorrectly states that the company is evaluating 12 jurisdictions, while the reference clearly states it is only four. This significant factual error demonstrates a lack of faithfulness and accuracy.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:Describe the potential impact of Proposition 22 on the company's business model.\n","Assistant Answer:Proposition 22 may require the company to modify its business model to comply with the new regulations.\n","Latency:2742.47 ms\n","Reference Answer:Proposition 22 may provide a framework that influences how the company classifies Drivers, potentially allowing for a different business model in California.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 3/5  \n","REASONING: The model output captures the essence of the reference answer by indicating a need for modification in the business model, but it lacks the specific mention of how Proposition 22 influences driver classification, which is a key point in the reference. Additionally, the language is somewhat vague, making it less clear and complete compared to the reference.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:What are the total Platform Participant direct transaction costs for the Mobility segment?\n","Assistant Answer:The total Platform Participant direct transaction costs for the Mobility segment were $1,444.\n","Latency:2374.72 ms\n","Reference Answer:The total Platform Participant direct transaction costs for the Mobility segment were $6,884.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 1/5  \n","REASONING: The model output provides an incorrect figure for the total Platform Participant direct transaction costs for the Mobility segment, stating $1,444 instead of the correct $6,884. This significant factual error undermines the faithfulness and accuracy of the response, leading to a very poor evaluation.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:What percentage of Gross Bookings does the company generate from trips in large metropolitan areas?\n","Assistant Answer:The company generates approximately 80% of its Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas.\n","Latency:2720.83 ms\n","Reference Answer:The provided text does not contain specific information.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 1/5  \n","REASONING: The model output provides a specific percentage (80%) that is not supported by the reference, which explicitly states that there is no specific information available. This constitutes a major issue of hallucination and inaccuracy.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:In what way could the resolution of the CA EDD audit influence the company's operational strategy?\n","Assistant Answer:The resolution of the CA EDD audit could influence the company's operational strategy by potentially impacting its ability to operate in California or altering its business practices.\n","Latency:4081.19 ms\n","Reference Answer:The provided text does not contain specific information.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 3/5  \n","REASONING: The model output provides a plausible interpretation of how the CA EDD audit resolution could influence operational strategy, but it lacks direct support from the reference, which states that it does not contain specific information. Additionally, while the answer is coherent, it does not fully address the absence of details in the reference, leading to a partially correct but incomplete response.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:How does the company's investment policy limit credit exposure, and what could be the implications of this strategy?\n","Assistant Answer:The company's investment policy limits credit exposure by not investing in instruments with a maturity of more than one year, which could reduce potential returns but also minimize credit risk.\n","Latency:4429.03 ms\n","Reference Answer:The company's investment policy limits credit exposure by restricting the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. The implications of this strategy could include reduced risk of significant losses from defaults and improved financial stability.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 3/5  \n","REASONING: The model output provides a different approach to limiting credit exposure by focusing on maturity rather than the amount of credit exposure with individual institutions, which is a key point in the reference. While it presents a valid strategy, it lacks completeness and does not address the implications of the strategy, making it partially correct but incomplete.\n","============================================================\n","Customer Question:What is the threshold income mentioned for mobility and delivery earners in Mexico to be classified as employees?\n","Assistant Answer:The threshold income mentioned for mobility and delivery earners in Mexico to be classified as employees is 20,000 Mexican pesos (approximately $1,000 USD) per month.\n","Latency:4703.38 ms\n","Reference Answer:The threshold income mentioned for mobility and delivery earners in Mexico to be classified as employees is more than one minimum salary a month.\n","LLM-as judge Score:SCORE: 2/5  \n","REASONING: The model output provides a specific income figure (20,000 Mexican pesos) that is not supported by the reference answer, which states the threshold is \"more than one minimum salary a month.\" This discrepancy indicates a major factual error and misinterpretation of the original information.\n","============================================================\n"]}],"source":["i=0\n","for row in test_dataset.iterrows():\n","
